        <h1>Self-taught fashion designer Alexis Lopez began her journey
            just three years ago. Her brand, Hex By Lex, started gaining traction 
            with pop-up shows all around El Paso. Alexis received her well-deserved
            recognition in July 2023 when she debuted her first fashion show.

            <p><b><span>FROM MUSIC FESTIVAL DREAMS TO A PASSION FOR FASHION: ALEXIS' JOURNEY</span></b><br/>
            When we asked Alexis to share her journey into the world of fashion design, her story was as inspiring 
            as it was relatable. It all began with a desire to stand out at a music festival.<br /><br/>
            "I actually started making clothes for myself because I wanted to go to a music festival, 
            and I had this vision of a specific outfit that I couldn’t find in my size anywhere,” she shared.<br /><br/>
            Faced with limited options, Alexis decided to take matters into her own hands. “My mom had a sewing machine 
            in the closet, and she was just like, ‘You should just take it out, learn, and teach yourself. It’s real quick; 
            it’s super easy.’” Encouraged by her mom’s advice, Alexis sat down at the table and taught herself how to sew 
            in just a few hours.<br /><br/>
            The result? Her very first handmade outfit—a unique piece that perfectly matched her vision and fit her like 
            a dream. But it didn’t stop there. “After that, I was like, this is super fun,” Alexis said, reflecting on 
            the experience. “I just started making clothes, and I’ve been making clothes ever since.”<br /><br/>
            What began as a simple solution to a wardrobe dilemma has blossomed into a full-fledged passion for 
            fashion design. For Alexis, sewing is more than just a skill; it’s a creative outlet and a way to express 
            her individuality. Her journey is a testament to the power of taking a chance, trusting your instincts, and 
            creating something truly your own.

            <p><b><span>THE INSPIRATION BEHIND ALEXIS' FASHION DESIGN</span></b><br/>
            When asked what inspired her to become a fashion designer, Alexis’ answer 
            reflected her deep connection to her craft and the people she creates for.<br /><br/>
            “I just really appreciated and liked the reactions that I was getting from people 
            when I would go out and wear my stuff. A lot of people would always ask, ‘Where did you get that? 
            That’s so cool, that’s so unique.’” Those compliments were encouraging, but the true inspiration 
            came when she started designing for others.<br/><br/>
            “When I started making clothes for other people, they told me that it would boost their confidence. 
            It would make them feel a lot better about themselves, and I really enjoyed that,” Alexis shared. 
            “That really made me want to keep pursuing this and just keep making everybody feel comfortable and 
            letting somebody unleash something else about themselves.” <br/><br/>
            For Alexis, fashion isn’t just about style; it’s about empowerment. Her designs help 
            people express their unique personalities and feel confident in their own skin. It’s this ability to 
            transform how others see and feel about themselves that continues to drive her passion for fashion design.

            <p><b><span>WHERE ALEXIS DRAWS INSPIRATION FOR HER DESIGNS</span></b><br/> 
            When it comes to finding inspiration for her designs, Alexis’s approach is both creative and nostalgic.<br/><br/>
            “Anywhere,” she said. “I do a lot from 90s and 2000s runways. I’ll go back and look at stuff from 
            that era since fashion cycles a lot. I go back and look at what was trending back then. 
            I’ll take familiar silhouettes and incorporate them into my fashion sense and go from there.”<br/><br/>
            By blending vintage aesthetics with modern sensibilities, Alexis creates designs that feel both 
            timeless and fresh. Her ability to draw from the past while innovating for the present makes her 
            work stand out in a crowded industry. It’s this unique perspective that keeps her creativity flowing 
            and her designs captivating.

            <p><b><span>ALEXIS' BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN FASHION</span></b><br/>
            When we asked Alexis about her biggest influences and role models in the fashion industry, 
            she didn’t hesitate to name one designer in particular.<br/><br/>
            “My biggest fashion inspiration is Roberto Cavalli,” she said. “I did pull a lot of inspiration 
            from Roberto Cavalli for this past year's collection. He’s one of my biggest go-to designers. I 
            really like his animal prints and the way that he incorporates them into classier designs. Instead 
            of taking them in a way where people usually think animal print equals tacky, he makes some classy 
            and beautiful pieces.”<br/><br/>
            Alexis’s admiration for Cavalli’s ability to transform bold patterns into sophisticated designs mirrors 
            her own approach to fashion—making people feel confident and unique in their own skin. By channeling 
            the creativity and elegance of her role models, Alexis continues to craft pieces that inspire and empower.

            <p><b><span>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS AND MILESTONES</span></b><br/>
            Alexis’ journey in fashion has been filled with memorable milestones. Reflecting on her career, she 
            shared one moment that stands out above the rest.<br/><br/>
            “They’re actually before I started doing fashion shows. I was just doing pop-ups around town 
            and getting my name out there,” she explained. “But last year, when I did my first fashion show 
            in July, it was insane. I boosted up my name and got all kinds of recognition. I gained followers 
            and people who liked my stuff and wanted to see more.”<br/><br/>
            The experience of showcasing her designs on the runway not only brought attention to her brand 
            but also fueled her creativity.<br/><br/>
            “The more people liked my stuff, the more it made me want to create the stuff that I saw in my head. 
            It’s just motivating,” Alexis said.<br/><br/>
            Her first fashion show marked a turning point, transforming her passion into a platform to reach a wider 
            audience. It’s moments like these that continue to inspire her as she carves out her path in the fashion world.<br/><br/>

            <br/>
            <p><b><span>GOALS FOR THE FUTURE</span></b><br/>
            Looking ahead, Alexis’ vision for her brand and career is both ambitious and deeply rooted in community.<br/><br/>
            “I just want to keep growing,” she shared. “I do want to grow the fashion industry here in El Paso, 
            but I want to grow it so much—not for me. I want to start to grow it and see where it can take 
            me, somewhere else. But I want to be able to create that for people here because there are so many 
            emerging fashion designers that think that they don’t have a place to do it because they’re not in 
            LA or New York. They’re not in those big places, but you can do whatever you want. You don’t have 
            to go there to do it; you just have to do it.”<br/><br/>
            Alexis’ passion for building opportunities in her hometown reflects her desire to make fashion 
            accessible and inclusive for everyone. By fostering a supportive environment for emerging designers, 
            she hopes to inspire others to follow their dreams, no matter where they are. Her vision for the future 
            is as bold and inspiring as her designs, promising a legacy that extends far beyond the runway.
