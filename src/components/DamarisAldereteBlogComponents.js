                There's something quietly powerful about a designer who turns heartbreak into
                ruffles, denial into a cocoon-shaped silhouette, and a difficult season of life into
                a 10-look runway collection. Damaris' work doesn't just focus on aesthetics. It tells 
                a story, turning emotion into shape, texture, and movement. And this is only the beginning
                of what she is building.

              Damaris is a fashion design student at UACJ-IADA (Universidad Autónoma de
              Ciudad Juárez) — part of its very first
              generation in the program — and the creative force behind Studio Mimari, her
              personal design project. Born and raised in Ciudad Juárez, she represents
              exactly the kind of emerging talent that the border region has been quietly
              growing for years, even when the infrastructure to support it hasn't always
              been there.<br/>
              We sat down with Damaris to talk about her journey, her creative process, and
              why she believes fashion deserves to be taken seriously as art.

          <h2>
            ROOTED IN TRADITION, EYES ON FANTASY
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Damaris didn't grow up dreaming of fashion week. She grew up watching her
            grandmother's work.<br/>
            "My two grandmothers were seamstresses," she shares. "One of them was a
            dressmaker — she created her own designs, sold them, and focused a lot on
            wedding dresses. Seeing their creations little by little started to catch my
            attention." Later, one of her grandmothers gave her her first sewing machine, 
            a gift that quietly changed the course of everything.<br/>
            From there, her love of cinema did the rest. Damaris and her brother share a
            passion for movies, and she started making a habit of designing and sewing
            outfits to wear to each new film premiere. "I started doing it more and more,
            and I really loved it," she says. "I loved the idea of imagining these fantastical
            worlds. That's when I thought — I'd really like to do this for a longer time, to
            dedicate myself to exploring that possibility."

          <h2>
            STUDYING IN A CITY THAT'S STILL LEARNING TO SEE FASHION AS ART
          </h2>
          <p2>
            When Damaris decided to pursue fashion design, there was only one place in
            Juárez where she could do it: the newly opened fashion design program at
            UACJ-IADA, which she joined as part of its inaugural class.<br/>
            "I think it's been a very fresh idea, especially for the border," she says. "I've
            seen so many people who were already longing for a program like this."
            But she's honest about the challenges, too. One of the biggest? The border's
            industrial identity doesn't always make room for fashion as an art form. "The
            city is very industrialized — it's about work clothes and that kind of thing," she
            explains. "And I've heard many people ask whether fashion is art or not, or
            whether it's just something that feeds vanity. I think there's still a stigma."
            She also points to very practical barriers: limited access to quality fabrics, few
            physical references and mentors nearby, and not enough exhibition spaces
            where emerging designers can show their work. "We need spaces to show what
            we do," she says simply.<br/>
            Despite all that, Damaris sees momentum building — especially since her
            classmates and fellow designers have started pushing beyond the university
            walls, presenting at events, and landing collaborations with brands. "I think
            we've already started," she says. "And I think it's going to keep growing."

            "My creative process is focusing on the
            theme I want to talk about, investigating
            how that theme feels for others, and then
            thinking about what it means to me... to
            finally guide it through this more
            romantic path."

          <h2>
            <i>EXPLOITS</i>: A COLLECTION ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT BREAKS YOU (AND
            SETS YOU FREE)
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Ask Damaris about her proudest achievement so far, and she'll tell you about
            'Exploits' — a 10-look collection she developed and presented this past summer
            at Fashion Desert, an annual event in Chihuahua.<br/>
            What made it remarkable: Fashion Desert doesn't normally accept students.
            Damaris was the exception. And they didn't just let her in — they gave her the
            opening slot.<br/>
            "I felt very fulfilled with this collection," she reflects. "I had to plan the entire
            development — how I wanted it presented, the atmosphere, even the music. I
            felt very realized."<br/>
            'Exploits' is conceptually rooted in the process of going through something
            painful and finding liberation on the other side. Each of the 10 looks represents
            a different stage of that transformation. The collection begins with a piece
            that's been called many things — an egg, a shell, a cocoon. Damaris describes it
            as the embodiment of denial: "Closing yourself off from what's happening, not
            wanting to accept reality."<br/>
            From there, the collection moves through grief, survival, and finally, release — all
            translated into ruffled, voluminous, deeply romantic silhouettes. The pink dress
            that many people first noticed when Arena shared it on Instagram? That's from
            'Exploits'.<br/>
            "What I like most is taking a story that might seem banal or even heartbreaking
            and transforming it into something poetic," Damaris says. "Something that, in
            the end, is also romantic."

          <h2>
            HER CREATIVE PROCESS: MEANING FIRST, EVERYTHING ELSE SECOND
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Damaris is known in her program for one thing: ruffles. Always ruffles. She also
            gravitates toward tulle — especially the stiffer varieties that give her structure
            and volume — and satin, which she loves for its texture despite how notoriously
            difficult it is to work with.<br/>
            But before any fabric gets cut, there's always a concept.<br/>
            "My creative process is focused on the theme I want to address," she explains. "I
            research how that theme affects other people, and then I think about how it
            affects me — and how I can adapt it to what I do and what I want to transmit.
            Which is always to guide it toward something more romantic."<br/>
            She describes her aesthetic as "a little maximalist" — which surprises even her,
            since she dresses quite minimally in everyday life. "In my designs I like volume, I
            like texture, and above all I like fantasy. I like creating something people don't
            normally see — something that looks a little strange."<br/>
            Her biggest design inspirations? Viktor & Rolf, for their irony. Iris Van Herpen, for
            her innovation and the coherence she creates across entire universes of design.
            And Thom Browne, for how exaggerated and playful everything he does is.

          <h2>
            WHAT'S NEXT: A DIEGO RIVERA-INSPIRED COLLABORATION AND A DREAM
            MAGAZINE
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Right now, Damaris is working on a collaborative collection with two of her
            classmates, commissioned by a stylist who specializes in color work for hair.
            The collection draws inspiration from Diego Rivera's massive mural 'Dream of a
            Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park', and is divided into three sections: gala,
            classic, and avant-garde — one per designer. It's sponsored by an Italian
            professional color brand, and it may debut in Chihuahua or potentially Mexico
            City.<br/>
            "It's our first big project with a brand," Damaris says. "We're excited. It's a little
            bit of a challenge to stay focused on the same reference and make it look
            cohesive, but what we've done so far is heading in a good direction."
            And longer-term? She wants to launch a magazine. One that challenges the
            idea that fashion has to be taken so seriously, that leans into the nonsense and
            the playfulness of design, and that gives visibility to other emerging designers
            who need a platform.<br/>
            "I want fashion to be perceived differently," she says. "I want it to not be seen
            as just vanity, but as the art that it is — to get more recognition as art. People
            who don't know our profession might think it's just about looks. But it's an
            enormous amount of work. It all starts from a tiny seed — a small idea — and
            there's an entire process of conceptualization before you ever arrive at the
            final garment, which is the only thing people see."<br/>
          </p2>
          <br/>
          <h2>
            ADVICE FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO START
          </h2>
          <p2>
            If you're thinking about jumping into fashion design, Damaris has a clear
            message for you: go wider than fashion itself.<br/>
            "Research not just fashion, but other art disciplines. Try to find meaning in
            other areas, too. And from the very beginning, do that introspection — figure
            out what message you want to give to the world through your designs. It's very
            easy to get lost along the way."<br/>
            And to her younger self — who spent time studying finance before the fashion
            program opened and changed everything?<br/>
            "I would have told myself to trust more in what I felt and what I thought. From
            early on I knew that another kind of degree wasn't my path. I should have
            listened to my own thoughts sooner."

            Between the cocoon dresses and cloud-like ruffles and the quietly poetic
            world she's building one look at a time, it's well worth a follow.
