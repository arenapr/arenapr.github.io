              <p>In a world where fashion is often dismissed as superficial, <i>Jackie</i> stands firmly at the intersection of art, 
                identity, and culture. At just 23 years old, this emerging designer and artist from Ciudad Juárez is challenging 
                traditional ideas of what fashion can be—transforming fabric, latex, and texture into statements of self-expression 
                and artistic research.

                Jackie is currently studying Arts at the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez (UACJ-IADA), where she explores the body 
                as a subject of artistic study. Her project, Gen01, started as a textile-learning experiment and evolved into a collective 
                dedicated to giving fashion the same respect and academic depth as photography, performance, or sculpture. Through 
                Gen01, she and her team experiment with materials like latex and curated textiles, approaching garments not as commercial 
                products but as unique, thoughtfully constructed pieces of art.

                Her creative process is deeply influenced by her grandmother, a seamstress who introduced her to the 
                craft of tailoring and design. <i>“I grew up watching her make clothes,”</i> Jackie recalls. <i>“She would sew 
                the designs I imagined, and that’s where it all started.”</i> Later, discovering the theatrical work of 
                <i>Alexander McQueen</i> would transform her perception of fashion forever. <i>“It was the moment I realized that 
                fashion could communicate like art—through emotion, through story, through beauty.”</i>

              <br/>
              <p>
                Jackie’s inspirations stretch beyond the global icons she admires—McQueen, Rick Owens, and Ann Demeulemeester—to 
                include local creatives like José Gaucin and Abraham Mora. <i>“They remind me that the dream is possible here,”</i> 
                she says. <i>“Seeing their dedication motivates me to keep going.”</i>

                But the reality of being an emerging artist on the border isn’t easy. Like many in the creative community, 
                Jackie balances multiple jobs while building her artistic practice. <i>“Finding time to create while working is 
                hard,”</i> she admits. <i>“But every small step matters. What keeps me going is knowing others here are doing the 
                same—working toward something bigger.”</i>
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                When asked about the challenges of building a career in fashion in a city known more for industry than for art, 
                Jackie doesn’t hesitate. <i>“We need more spaces that take fashion seriously,”</i> she says. <i>“We need dialogue, 
                collaboration, and a sense of community. It shouldn’t just be about selling—it should be about creating 
                identity.”</i>
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Jackie’s dream for the future is to build a collaborative creative space—a kind of artist’s house—where designers, 
                photographers, and makers can share ideas and grow together. <i>“I imagine a place where each person has their corner 
                to create, but we’re all connected. That’s what I want.”</i>
              </p>
              <br/>

              <br/>
              <p>
                Jackie’s advice for anyone just starting in fashion is simple but powerful: be constant, stay curious, and take 
                yourself seriously. <i>“Sometimes we think people won’t understand what we’re doing,”</i> she says, <i>“but you’ll be 
                surprised. There’s always someone ready to collaborate, to believe in you. You just have to ask.”</i>
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Through her vision, persistence, and passion, Jackie represents what <i>ARENA</i> stands for: community, creativity, 
                and courage. One grain of sand at a time, she’s helping redefine what it means to create on the border.
