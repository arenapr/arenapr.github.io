          <h1>At just 24 years old, Nath de La Mora has already carved a name for himself in the fashion 
              world—but his journey started humbly, at a sewing machine in his grandmother’s living room.
          </h1>
          <div className='nath-body-container'>
            <div className='nath-left-column'>
              <p>Born and raised in Ciudad Juárez, Nath’s earliest memories of fashion involve watching his grandmother 
                 sew and flipping through <i>VOGUE</i> magazines. That quiet fascination quickly grew into a passion, and eventually 
                 a career that’s now reaching international runways and celebrity closets.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>Today, his brand, <i>HYPNOSIS</i>, has become a standout name in Mexico’s emerging fashion scene. With a design aesthetic 
                 he calls “<i>Clásicamente Extravagante</i>” (Classically Extravagant), Nath creates bold silhouettes that are surprisingly 
                 easy to wear. “With HYPNOSIS, I want every woman to feel elegant, complete, and confident enough to be different,” 
                 he says. He draws inspiration from Latin American designers like Johanna Ortiz and blends it with his own sense of 
                 timelessness and edge.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>His design journey started with a simple need: to create clothes he couldn’t find for himself. “I couldn’t find the kind 
                of clothes I liked, so I started designing for me,” Nath explains. This personal approach is still at the core of his creative 
                process. He believes in crafting pieces that last forever—timeless staples that make dressing up easier and more meaningful. 
                “There’s always that feeling of having a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear. I want to solve that.”
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>For Nath, fashion is more than trends—it’s a form of dreaming and storytelling. He emphasizes variety in fabrics and textures, 
                letting materials guide the direction of each piece. One of his most colorful and spontaneous collections was <i>POPURRÍ</i>, a mix of
                 vibrant fabrics without a set theme, designed to offer a little something for everyone.

              <br/>
              <p>His big break came in <i>2022</i>, when he was contacted by a fashion showroom in Mexico City. That opportunity catapulted 
                his career to new heights. Soon after, his designs were featured in <i>Reforma, Estilo DF</i>, and even <i>InStyle Greece</i>. 
                “That was one of the most rewarding moments of my career—I truly didn’t expect it,” he shares.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>Nath’s latest collection, <i>Atardecer</i>, is a deeply personal tribute to his late grandmother Ofelia. “I felt a lot of 
                solitude after she passed,” he says. Inspired by her favorite song, Cruz de Olvido, Atardecer is not just a seasonal 
                collection—it’s a form of healing. “She taught me how to sew.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>She was my first model and the first person I ever designed for.” One of the collection’s most emotional pieces is 
                 a recreated version of her favorite dress from 30 years ago.

              <p>Despite the fast-paced and often overwhelming nature of the fashion industry, Nath stays grounded by simply continuing 
                 to create. He finds motivation in the messages he receives from fans and supporters. “When someone tells me they love 
                 what I do, that’s what keeps me going.”
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>With a physical boutique in Ciudad Juárez, and growing recognition in both national and international circles, Nath has 
                 big dreams for the future. “I want to open my own workroom and see my designs on the cover of <i>VOGUE</i>—that’s the ultimate dream.” 
                 He also hopes to dress actress Cecilia Suárez from <i>La Casa de las Flores</i> one day.

              <br/>
              <p>Nath is proof that big dreams can grow from small beginnings. His advice to other young designers?
              <br/><br/>
                  <i2>“Be honest with yourself. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. And whatever you do, do it while dreaming. Dream of the sky—but 
                    always keep your feet on the ground.”</i2><br/><br/>
