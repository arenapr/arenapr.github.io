              <p>If you’ve been keeping an eye on the emerging fashion scene in Ciudad Juárez, chances are you’ve heard the name 
                 <i>Hilvenia Collective</i>. If you haven’t, don’t worry. You’re about to fall in love.<br/><br/>
                 Made up of four young designers from UACJ-IADA—Daniel Ramos, Franko Gonzalez (aka Zade), Itzél Galván, and Celeste De 
                 León—Hilvenia is proof that Juárez is <i>not just</i> part of the conversation… it’s starting one.<br/><br/>
                I sat down with the group for a fun, free-flowing convo over Zoom, and here’s what I learned: this collective isn’t just making clothes. 
                They’re creating <i>movements</i>—through story, self-expression, and a whole lot of heart.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <h1>How It Started: From Hallway Dreams to a Pride Runway</h1>
              <p>
                Like all great origin stories, Hilvenia was born in the hallways of IADA at the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez (UACJ). 
                <i>“It started with three students just sitting on the floor like, 'Hey, let’s do a fashion show,'”</i> said Celeste, laughing. <i>“And somehow, it happened.”</i>
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                What began as a casual brainstorm between classmates turned into a full-blown runway show for Pride Month—in just three weeks. The show, held in collaboration with Juárez 
                Diversa, featured drag performers, folkloric dancers, poetry readings, and a wildly eclectic set of designs. They directed it. Styled it. Designed for it. Promoted it. The whole thing. And what came out wasn’t just a show—it was a statement.

              <p>
                After the Pride runway glow faded, the Hilvenia crew didn’t slow down—they leveled up. We dove deeper into dreams, roadblocks, and what it really means to be a young 
                creative on the border. For Franko, the biggest realization was this: <i>"A year ago, I dreamed of doing a runway show. Now that we’ve done it, I’m asking—what’s next?"</i>
                 The answer? A whole lot. From collaborating with other artists to one day helping more local creatives get visibility, Hilvenia’s long game is all about community.
                 <i>"I want Juárez to be a place where fashion doesn’t feel competitive or elitist,”</i> Franko said. <i>“If one of us shines, we all shine.”</i>

                Each member of the collective brings a unique flavor to the collective:<br/><br/>
                <i>Celeste</i> draws inspiration from icons like Madonna and Cher, blending glam and power into elegant, structured designs. <i>“My style? Maybe formal, maybe modern—but 
                  always me,”</i> she said.<br/><br/>
                <i>Daniel</i> went full Gaga for the Pride show. <i>“I made sunglasses out of burnt cigarettes and styled the hair with Coke cans,”</i> he said. <i>“I’m all about concept. 
                  Every design needs a why.”</i><br/><br/>
                <i>Franko</i> thrives on emotion and improvisation. <i>“Sometimes you don’t need a perfect plan—you need the right feeling,”</i> he said. <i>“I love storytelling and letting accidents 
                  become part of the look.”</i><br/><br/>
                <i>Itzél</i> fuses emo and goth aesthetics with musical inspiration. For the runway, she channeled Joan Jett into a bold red fishnet outfit layered with chains and sheer fabrics. 
                <i>“Music helps me create—sound becomes visual.”</i>

                Of course, being a young designer in Juárez isn’t always sequins and spotlight. There’s still stigma, misunderstanding and people who see fashion as a hobby, not a 
                career. Hilvenia wants to change all of that.
                <i>“It’s about showing people what we do,”</i> said Itzél. <i>“When they see the hours, the process, the stress, and the love behind one outfit—they get it.” </i>
                Franko chimed in with a story: <i>“We had to do makeup at the food court in Plaza de las Américas for our last show. A security guard kicked us out because we didn’t 
                have permission. That’s fashion behind the scenes—messy, chaotic, but ours.” </i> 
                Daniel added: <i>“Even my dad didn’t get it—until he saw our show. He told me after, ‘If this is what you love, I’ll support you forever.’ That’s the power of doing the 
                work and sharing it.”</i><br/><br/>
                Beyond runway looks and red thread, Hilvenia is serious about changing perceptions. <i>“We want people to stop treating fashion like a hobby,”</i> said Itzél. 
                <i>“This is real work. This is serious craft.”</i>
                As a collective, Hilvenia wants to launch individual brands, spotlight Juárez designers, and collectively make the border a recognized hub for creativity and style.
                <i>“We want to make sure the world sees what Juárez has to offer,”</i> Daniel added. <i>“It’s not about competition—it’s about collaboration, and visibility.”</i>

              <p>
                When I asked them what was coming up next, I got a lot of cheeky smiles and a few <i>“it’s still a secret”</i> responses—but here’s what they did spill: Daniel and Franko are 
                headed to a music festival, bringing custom pieces to show to artists backstage—basically guerrilla networking in style. Celeste is launching her own lingerie brand, 
                which she’s been working on quietly for months. Daniel just had a design re-featured in a photo shoot and is teaming up with a well-known photographer for a styling project. 
                Itzél is taking a short break to recharge for what’s coming up next. (fashion naps are essential too).

                Talking to Hilvenia Collective felt like getting a sneak peek into the future of fashion—raw, fearless, and deeply connected to community. They’re a reminder that sometimes 
                the most powerful movements begin with a serious vision, collaboration and passion.<br/><br/>
                These four aren’t just sewing garments, they’re stitching together an entire scene, right here on the border. They believe in collaboration over competition, and building 
                a fashion future that’s ours and not imported. And honestly? I believe in them.<br/><br/>
                Hilvenia Collective, we see you and we can’t wait for what’s next!<br/><br/>
