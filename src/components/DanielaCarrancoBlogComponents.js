                FROM HIGH SCHOOL SEWING CLASS TO COLLEGE RUNWAYS
            </h2>
            <p2>
                Ask Daniela Carranco when she fell for fashion, and she’ll say it’s a feeling she’s
                always had—not a single moment.<br/>
                “I’ve loved fashion for as long as I can remember,” she says. And much of that
                love started at home.<br/>
                Daniela grew up watching her mom manage a boutique in Mexico, handling
                styling, marketing, and finances. Fashion meant creativity, expression, and
                confidence. Early on, Daniela saw how powerful clothing could be.<br/>
                By the time she was a kid, she was already making clothes for her dolls. Sewing
                machines came later. At first, it was glue sticks, imagination, and the desire to
                create something from nothing. “It wasn’t sewing,” she laughs, “but I was still
                creating.” High school at Franklin brought Daniela to a fashion sewing program,
                where she learned to use machines properly, construct garments, and see
                fabric as more than material—she saw possibility. “That was when I knew,” she
                says. “This is what I want to do.”

                    Today, Daniela is studying Fashion
                    Merchandising and Design at New
                    Mexico State University and
                    commuting from El Paso to Las
                    Cruces several times a week. Her
                    strength? Sewing and garment
                    construction. But her experience
                    goes far beyond the classroom. She’s
                    worked on alterations, costume
                    design for theater, props for specific
                    looks, and even runs a small
                    alterations business on the side.
                    On top of that, she’s participated in
                    NMSU’s annual sustainable fashion
                    shows every year, creating garments
                    out of plastic bags, tape, water
                    bottles, and recycled materials.
                    Sustainability isn’t a trend for her. It’s
                    been built into her education from
                    day one—a foundation that has
                    shaped her creative journey as she
                    brings her sustainable vision to life.

            SUSTAINABILITY, BUT MAKE IT FASHION
          </h2>
          <p2>
            One of Daniela’s standout pieces is a red corset with a bright blue skirt and
            floral details made from plastic placemats and fabric scraps. The idea began as
            a sketch, then took shape through research, trial, error, and lots of
            hand-sewing.<br/>
            “I wanted it to feel bold,” she explains. “Red and turquoise blue, flowers on top
            and bottom—something you don’t see every day, but that’s still wearable.” The
            process was tough. Unconventional materials require constant problem-solving:
            deciding when to sew, glue, or layer, and ensuring the garment looks clean and
            professional. “It’s challenging,” she admits, “but it’s fun. You really learn how
            creative you can be.”

                opportunities emerging
                here in the Southwest

          <h2>
            FASHION INSPIRATION COMES FROM EVERYWHERE
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Daniela’s inspiration is everywhere—movies, theater, music, and books all
            influence her. She loves films that prompt her to imagine character wardrobes.
            Music shapes her style too: some days Frank Sinatra inspires classic silhouettes,
            other days ’90s grunge brings out her edgier side.<br/>
            And then there are books. “I picture the characters, where they live, and what
            they’re experiencing,” she says. “I imagine their clothes.” Right now, she’s
            reading First Lie Wins, a book with country-club polish and darker undertones.
            That inspires her to think of bold colors, Audrey Hepburn-like silhouettes, and
            more mysterious looks as the story deepens.

            BUILDING A FUTURE IN THE SOUTHWEST
          </h2>
          <p2>
            Too often, fashion is associated only with cities like New York or Los Angeles.
            Daniela believes that mindset overlooks the creativity, culture, and stories coming
            out of the border communities.<br/>
            “We’re a different environment,” she says. “And different is worth looking at.”
            She wants to build a career that doesn’t just take her away but eventually brings
            everything back home. To show others that you don’t have to leave forever to do
            what you love. She believes El Paso and the surrounding borderplex offer a
            "treasure" of a different environment that the fashion world hasn't seen yet.
            "You don't have to leave home forever," she explains. "You can do what you love,
            bring it back, and help your community grow."<br/>
            With graduation in May, Daniela is open to internships, costume work, styling, or
            design. She’s eager to keep learning and growing. “Fashion is powerful,” she says.
            “It’s something you wear and feel good about. Something you can connect to.”
            Her big goals are rooted in something personal: storytelling, culture, and
            community.<br/>
            Daniela reminds us that powerful fashion stories don’t only come from big cities,
            they are being written right here on the border. Follow Daniela’s journey and join
            ARENA in supporting the next generation of borderland creatives.
