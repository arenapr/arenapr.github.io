          <p3>If you’ve ever thought crochet was just a “grandma hobby,” Andy Castaneda is here to completely flip that
              idea on its head.

            Andy is a fiber artist based in El Paso, working under the name Cosmic Fiber (<a href="https://instagram.com/cosmicfiber" style={{ fontSize: '16px' }}>@cosmicfiber</a>), and their work lives somewhere
            between sculpture, fashion, and wearable art. During our ARENA creative call, we talked about anxiety, slow fashion,
            drag inspiration, unconventional materials, and why making things with your hands might actually be a small
            act of rebellion.

          <h2>From Yarn Kits to Wearable Art</h2>
          <p2>Andy’s journey with fiber arts started early. They learned to knit as a teenager, first making small dolls and animals, then moving on to accessories
              like scarves and shawls. Crochet came later, but once it entered the picture, things really took off.<br/>
              What started as accessories slowly evolved into garments, statement pieces, and eventually runway moments. Today, Andy’s work blends crochet, knitting,
              upcycling, wire, beads, and even metal—pushing fiber arts far beyond their traditional box.<br/>
              Her aesthetic? Eclectic, chameleon-like, sometimes chaotic (in the best way). Bright colors one day, dark and grungy the next. No rules, no single lane.

          <h2>
            “Amalgamation”: Anxiety Made Wearable
          </h2>
          <p2>
            One of Andy’s standout pieces is Amalgamation, a sculptural wearable inspired by artist Nick Cave’s sound suits. It’s bold, textured, and emotional—literally built
            around the places Andy feels anxiety most: her shoulders and back.<br/>
            The piece combines upcycled garments, knitted and crocheted elements, copper wire, beads, and sound. Yes, sound. Andy added a knitted waveform panel to
            reference how sound affects presence—like the click of heels or the stomp of boots entering a room.<br/>
            “It feels like all this weight is upon me,” Andy shared. Amalgamation captures that hyper-awareness and tension, but transforms it into something powerful,
            expressive, and (almost) ready to walk out the door.
          </p2>

          <h2>
            Fiber Arts vs. Fast Fashion
          </h2>
          <p2>
            When the conversation turned to slow fashion, Andy didn’t hold back. For them, slow fashion is about reclaiming control from a system built on
            overconsumption and burnout. Fiber arts take time. Machines can’t mass-produce Crochet. Every stitch is human, intentional, and imperfect—and
            that’s the point.<br/>
            Andy talked about how the pandemic sparked a renewed interest in crafts and making things by hand. People are starting to ask better questions:
            Who made this? How long did it take? And, do I actually need it?<br/>
            Her work is a direct response to fast fashion culture—and they dream of hosting mending workshops so people can repair and extend the life of their
            clothes instead of throwing them away.

            <h1>“Slow fashion is the reclamation of control back from a system we’ve been forced into.”</h1>

          <h2>Unconventional Materials & Drag Inspiration</h2>
          <p2>
            One of the most exciting parts of Andy’s practice is their love for unconventional
            materials. She’s currently dreaming up a crocheted top-and-skirt set made
            entirely from cables and extension cords. (Yes, really.)<br/>
            She credits shows like Project Runway and the drag community for pushing
            creative boundaries. Drag artists, she says, are some of the most resourceful
            designers out there, using everything from industrial materials to sugar
            sculptures to bring their visions to life.<br/>
            That same ingenuity shows up in Andy’s work: crochet meets copper wire, denim
            meets lace, fiber meets fashion.
          </p2>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>Community Is Everything</h2>
          <p2>
            Andy is very clear about one thing: none of this happens in isolation.<br/>
            From local art markets to supportive shop owners like Michelle from Pineapple
            Vintage (who helped get Andy’s work onto a runway), community has been
            essential. Seeing their pieces modeled—especially by Miss El Paso—was a
            surreal, validating moment.<br/>
            “It was something my hands did,” Andy said. “And people were enjoying it.”<br/>
            They also shared a dream we fully agree with: El Paso needs more shared creative
            spaces. Think craft nights, fiber circles, creative reuse centers (basically craft
            thrift stores), and places where artists can make, talk, and grow together.

          <h2>Art, Fashion, or Somewhere In Between?</h2>
          <p2>
            When asked whether they see their work as art or fashion, Andy’s answer was
            simple: both.<br/>
            They want their pieces to be functional and wearable, but never at the cost of the
            vision. Their long-term goal? A complete collection and a runway show of her
            own—something eclectic, expressive, and entirely them.<br/>
          </p2>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>Advice for Emerging Artists</h2>
          <p2>
            Andy’s advice is refreshingly honest and encouraging:<br/>
            Put your work out there. Wear what you make. Go to markets. Ask questions. Don’t
            assume the answer is no.<br/>
            Sometimes the best opportunities start with someone asking, “Where did you get
            that?” and being brave enough to say, “I made it.”<br/>
            At ARENA, conversations like this are exactly why we exist—to spotlight artists
            like Andy, remind people that fashion is art and labor, and prove that creativity is
            alive and thriving in the borderland.
