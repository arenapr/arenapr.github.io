          <p>Janace Griffin—better known as Junkdredz—is a creative force who’s done it all and still manages to 
            keep us guessing about what she’ll tackle next. A published children’s book author, founder of The 
            El Paso Black Arts Association, and all-around artistic powerhouse, Janace doesn’t just stop there. 
            She’s also out here chasing her dream of being a fashion designer—and absolutely crushing it.<br/><br/>
            From major publications to iconic events, Janace’s designs have been showcased on platforms we all know: 
            KVIA, KTSM, PBS, The City Magazine, the UTEP Prospector, MagsBlack Magazine, Vigour Magazine—you name it! 
            Add appearances at The Crossland Art Gallery, Audi Fashion Week, and L.A. Fashion Week, and we’re talking 
            serious trailblazing. Oh, and did we mention The El Paso Strong Fashion Show? Yeah, she created that. 
            For free. Every. Single. Year.

              <p><b><span>PAINTED LADIES: A PROUD MOMENT</span></b><br/>
                With four stunning collections in the books, Janace isn’t short on proud accomplishments. 
                But one that truly holds a special place in her heart? The Painted Ladies Collection. 
                This one went deep—tapping into the emotional turmoil of toxic relationships and domestic 
                violence survivors.<br/><br/>
                In her own words:<br/><br/>
                  <i>“The whole thought behind it was throwing the paint and slashing the dress 
                  because it’s almost like what I feel like women can go through during relationships 
                  like that.”</i><br/><br/>
                It wasn’t just fashion—it was healing, empowerment, and art combined.

              <p><b><span>DEATH BY DENIM: A JOURNEY OF TRANSFORMATION</span></b><br/>
                Janace’s Death by Denim Fashion Show hits different. This collection is personal—a reflection 
                of her life over the past few transformative years. From the heartbreaking loss of her father 
                in 2018 to marriage, parenthood, career changes, and shifting friendships, Janace’s life has 
                been a rollercoaster of endings and beginnings.<br/><br/>
                The show’s concept is powerful: It symbolizes life’s constant cycle of death and rebirth. Each day, 
                we’re given the opportunity to wake up as new people, ready to take on fresh goals, passions, or 
                dreams.<br/><br/>
                And what better material to capture this idea than <strong>denim</strong>?
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p><b><span>WHY DENIM?</span></b><br/>
                Denim is the ultimate metaphor for reinvention. Like denim, our experiences—no matter how ripped, 
                worn, or beaten down—can become badges of honor. Janace reminds us that we are not defined by our 
                struggles but refined by them.<br/><br/>
                Whether it’s losing a job, hitting a low point, or weathering change, Death by Denim challenges 
                us to upcycle and recycle not just fabrics, but our lives. To take what we’ve overcome and emerge 
                <strong> stronger</strong>, <strong>bolder</strong>, and <strong>better</strong>.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p><b><span>FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS, NO MATTER WHAT</span></b><br/>
                If you’re looking for motivation to chase your own goals, Janace has some advice:<br/><br/>
                  <i>“I believe in following your dreams and never giving up, no matter where you are or who you 
                    know. It doesn’t even matter if you have a solid plan– just start moving forward, and the 
                    direction will reveal itself as you go.”</i><br/><br/>
                Whether you want to snap photos, design clothes, or write that bestseller, grab that camera, 
                dust off the sewing machine, upgrade that laptop. Start now. Invest in yourself. And let 
                the journey unfold.

                Janace Griffin is not just paving the way for Black artists—she’s showing us all that no dream 
                is too big and no transformation is too bold.
