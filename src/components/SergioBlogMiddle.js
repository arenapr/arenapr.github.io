              <p>When you think of fashion, you might picture glamorous runways, polished collections, and glossy magazine 
                  covers. But for designer Sergio Estrada, fashion is far more personal. It’s a way to navigate emotions 
                  and tell his truth to anyone willing to listen—or, in his case, to wear it. His brand, <strong>PARANOID</strong>, reflects 
                  all the messy, raw feelings that life throws at us, and it resonates with people who crave authenticity in 
                  a world full of trends.<br/><br/>
                  “I don’t know if it’s because someone broke my heart,” Sergio laughs, explaining how he first got 
                  into fashion. “But I just love expressing myself through clothes. I like creating feelings in people.”<br/><br/>
                  His personal experiences deeply inspire Sergio’s work, and if you sense a dark, edgy tone, you’re right on track. 
                  He describes his work as a mirror of his own experiences—especially the tough ones. “It’s like all my emotions 
                  come out in the clothes. People might not understand it, but that’s me. That’s my truth.”<br/><br/>
                  While fashion often rides the line between art and commerce, Sergio makes it clear that art comes first. 
                  “Fashion should be an art form,” he says passionately. “But I’m learning to balance art with 
                  the commercial side because that’s part of the industry.” Even if it’s not his favorite aspect, he 
                  knows it’s necessary to grow and evolve.

          When it comes to influences, Sergio pulls inspiration from fashion giants who broke the mold. “Rick Owens is a 
          big one because he’s creating these fantasy clothes, and the industry just lets him be himself. That’s what I 
          strive for.” He also credits Virgil Abloh and Kanye West, both icons who have shaped culture and creativity. “Kanye’s 
          controversial, but you can’t deny his genius—he knows how to market and create at the right time. That’s why he’s 
          uncancelable.”<br/><br/>
          For Sergio, one show stands out as a significant milestone in his career: his El Paso Strong fashion show in 2024. 
          To Sergio, it wasn’t just about clothes—it was about creating a moment in a place that felt impossible to pull off.<br/><br/>
          “Honestly, the El Paso Strong fashion show was probably the only thing I’ve been truly proud of,” he admits. And 
          it’s easy to see why. The event was held at a landmark spot in El Paso’s vibrant Downtown San Jacino area, an unexpected 
          yet perfect setting for Sergio’s vision. “I never even thought about having a show there,” he reflects. “But we did it. 
          And I went all in—from the research to the mood boards to the execution. I felt like, for once, everything I put into 
          this really showed. It paid off in ways I didn’t expect.”<br/><br/>
          But, like a true artist, Sergio isn’t stopping there. As proud as he is of his growth, he knows there’s still work 
          to do. “It’s crazy looking back and seeing how much better my quality has gotten. But it’s not there yet. It’s 
          gotta be better, better, better—always.”<br/><br/>
          For Sergio, the real reward isn’t fame or accolades; it’s growth. “Honestly, I’m never satisfied, but seeing my progress 
          is crazy. I never thought I’d be in this position. I used to be a nobody, and now people care about what I have to say. 
          That’s wild.”<br/><br/>
          Sergio has walked the self-taught path and acknowledges its value, but he doesn’t sugarcoat his advice for aspiring 
          fashion designers: “Self-taught is cool, but if you want to make it in this industry, you need school. You learn so 
          much in just two semesters—everything you need to know. My teachers have been in the industry for years, and that knowledge 
          is priceless.”<br/><br/>
          The lessons he’s learned extend far beyond the classroom, though. “Stay true to yourself. It sounds corny, but it’s real. 
          Always keep doing you, and people are always going to get behind you, regardless.”<br/><br/>
          In a world full of trends, Sergio Estrada and PARANOID are carving out a space for fashion that’s honest and unapologetically 
          real.<br/><br/>
          <strong>Sergio’s drive for perfection is exactly what makes him one to watch. The El Paso Strong fashion show may have been a turning 
          point, but if there’s one thing we know about him, it’s that he’s just getting started.</strong>
