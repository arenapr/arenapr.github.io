                 There is a new wave of creative talent emerging on the border, and 21-year-old designer Alicia Flores is one 
                 of the names leading that momentum. Currently finishing her last semester at EPCC Fashion and preparing to continue 
                 her studies at NMSU Alicia is already building a thoughtful, ambitious foundation for her brand, Enedina Rose.
                 <br/><br/>
                  In our conversation, she opened up about her beginnings, her creative process, the pressures of being an emerging 
                  designer, and the lunar-inspired collection that has completely transformed the way she sees her work.

          <h2>Discovering Fashion (and Herself) One Experiment at a Time</h2>
          <br/>
          <p2>
            Alicia didn’t grow up planning to become a designer. In fact, she once thought about studying medicine. But everything 
            shifted when, as a teenager, she found herself cutting, reshaping, and hand-sewing her own clothes simply because the 
            outfits she imagined didn’t exist in stores.
            <br/><br/>
             Her parents noticed before she did.<br/>
             “They would tell me, ‘You style your outfits really well,’” she recalled.
            <br/><br/>
            It wasn’t until her mom encouraged her to draw the pieces she envisioned and make them herself that she realized how 
            naturally design came to her.

              <img src='../images/alicia2.jpg' alt='AliciaFloresImage'></img>
              <p2>
                By the time she discovered EPCC’s Fashion program after high school, she knew she had found the right path.<br/>
                “I didn’t know how to sew at all when I entered the program,” she said. “But once I started making things with my 
                hands, I knew this is where I belonged.”

          <h2>Finding Inspiration Everywhere—Especially in the Moon</h2>
          <div className='alicia-flores-images-container2'>
              <p2>
                Music, long nighttime walks, and photography fuel much of Alicia’s creative thinking. She listens to The Marías 
                and Pink Floyd at full volume to picture silhouettes, textures, and moods. She also spends a 
                lot of time photographing the moon, which eventually became the anchor for her newest work.<br/><br/>
                Her current collection titled “Selene” Alicia explores the eight phases of the moon, through eight womenswear 
                looks and eight menswear looks. The project has become a full creative journey: research, sketchbooks, fabric 
                experiments, and unexpected materials.<br/><br/>
                One of the most striking elements she developed is a bustier made of joint cement, molded to mimic the surface and 
                texture of the lunar landscape.
              </p2>

          <div className='alicia-flores-images-container2'>
              <p2>
                  “Everyone told me no one would wear cement,” she laughed, “but I’m figuring it out. I want to try something new.”<br/><br/>
                  Alicia dove deep into NASA imagery to build her color palette, studying how the moon shifts in hue depending 
                  on light, shadow, and distance. What began as a simple idea evolved into a collection with layers of symbolism, 
                  technique, and storytelling.<br/><br/>
                  Alicia will present the womenswear portion of this project in May at EPCC, with plans to show the full 
                  collection—including menswear—later next year during a local Fashion Week event.

          <h2>Balancing Pressure, Creativity, and Growth</h2>
          <div className='alicia-flores-images-container'>
              <p2>
              Like many emerging designers, Alicia is learning to navigate time, demanding deadlines, and the emotional pressure 
              that comes with creative work. She admits that one of her biggest challenges is managing her schedule and knowing when 
              to step back.<br/><br/>
              After attempting to produce ten outfits for a fashion show within three months, she experienced her first anxiety attack.<br/>
              “That taught me a lot,” she said. “I like working under pressure, but I also learned the importance of resting. My health 
              has to come first.”<br/>
              </p2>
              <img src='../images/Alicia-quote.png' class="second-img" alt='AliciaFloresImage'></img>
          </div>
          <p2>
              She also discussed the challenges she faces with communication, such as presenting her work, public speaking, and trusting 
              her ideas. As an introverted designer, stepping out of her comfort zone remains a part of her learning process, but she takes 
              pride in how far she has come.
          </p2>
          <br/><br/>
          <h2>The Borderland Fashion Community: A Creative ‘Tribe’ in the Making</h2>
          <p2>
              Throughout our conversation, Alicia expressed how meaningful it is to see more students and young designers entering the industry 
              in both El Paso and Juárez.<br/><br/>
              “When I started at EPCC, I was the only one from my high school studying fashion,” she said. “Now I’m seeing more people join. It 
              feels like we’re all building something together.”<br/><br/>
              She believes that the regional industry is growing, but it still requires more community support and recognition. While art, music, 
              and performance already enjoy strong followings, fashion is still striving to be acknowledged as a legitimate art form, despite its 
              complexity, craftsmanship, and cultural significance.

              <h2>“Designers here are artists too, and it’s exciting to see everyone coming together.”</h2>

          <h2>Looking Ahead: The Future of Enedina Rose</h2>
          <div className='alicia-flores-images-container'>
              <p2>
                  When asked about her long-term goals, Alicia answered without hesitation: She dreams of establishing a studio—complete with 
                  machines, work tables, and a team—and expanding Enedina Rose into a brand that people recognize and admire.<br/>
                  “I want people to hear the name and know it represents something meaningful,” she said.<br/><br/>
                  Her dream is not just global reach, but creative independence: a space where she can explore, experiment, and lead a brand shaped 
                  by elegance, curiosity, and innovation.<br/>
                  After chatting with Alicia, it’s obvious she’s set her sights high—she’s aiming for the moon and has a real shot at making it happen.<br/><br/>
